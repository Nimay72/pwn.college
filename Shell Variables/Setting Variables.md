```
pwn.college{Iuzh-qb5xRNs7yR8i7mZqbVUdex.dlTN1QDL1EjN0czW}
```

For this task we had to assign the value of the variable PWN as COLLEGE.
We use = operator which assigns the value college to the variable PWN using the command PWN=COLLEGE.
Initial mistake: Used command PWN = COLLEGE.
The spaces were not allowed so the correct command to be used is PWN=COLLEGE WITHOUT ANY SPACE
